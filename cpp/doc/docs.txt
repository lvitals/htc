cpp - C Preprocessor

Description:
The `cpp` command is a C preprocessor that processes source code files before compilation. It handles macro expansions, include directives, and conditional compilation.

Usage:
cpp [options] [input-file [output-file]]

Options:
    -C
        Pass all comments to the output. By default, comments are removed.
    -Dname
        Defines 'name' as 1. This is equivalent to `#define name 1` in the source code.
    -Dname=var
        Defines 'name' as 'val'. This is equivalent to `#define name val` in the source code.
    -H
        Print the path names of include files to standard error as they are processed.
    -Idirectory
        Adds 'directory' to the list of directories searched for include files. Directories are searched in the order they appear on the command line.
    -M
        Generate a list of dependencies (Makefile format) and write them to the output. This is useful for build systems to track file dependencies.
    -P
        Do not include line control information (e.g., `#line` directives) in the preprocessor output.
    -R
        Allow recursive macro expansions. By default, `cpp` might limit recursion to prevent infinite loops.
    -Uname
        Remove any initial definition of 'name'. This undefines a macro that might be predefined by the system or other options.
    -U
        Remove all initially predefined macros. This clears the default set of macros provided by the preprocessor.
    -Ydirectory
        Uses 'directory' instead of the standard system include directory. This overrides the default system include path.
    -h, --help
        Print this usage information and exit.
    --noinclude
        Ignore the standard system include path. Only directories specified with -I will be searched.
    --version
        Show `cpp` version information and exit.
